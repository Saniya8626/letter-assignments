					Dear Mr Abhi
				</div>

				<div class="letter-body-message">
					<p>
					<p>A constellation consists of visible stars that form a perceived outline or pattern, usually
						representing an animal, a person or mythological creature, or an inanimate object.</p>
					<p>The origins of the first constellations date back to prehistoric times. Their purpose was to tell
						stories of their beliefs, experiences, creation, or mythology. The recognition of constellations
						has changed over time. They varied in size or shape, others became popular and then were
						forgotten, and some were limited to a single culture.</p>
					<p>In the 20th century, a committee of the International Astronomical Union took it upon itself to
						accurately delineate the 88 constellations. It included 48 ancient constellations enumerated by
						the Greek astronomer Ptolemy, plus 40 new constellations. Each constellation is a region of the
						sky, and together they cover the entire celestial sphere.</p>
					<p>These 88 constellations divide the entire night sky as seen from Earth. Star maps are made from
						the brightest stars, and the patterns they form give rise to the constellation names.</p>
					<p>The star charts represent the position of the stars as we see them from Earth; however, the stars
						in each constellation may not be close to each other, as some we perceive to be brighter because
						they are close to the Earth.</p>
					<p>Sincerely,</p>
					</p>
